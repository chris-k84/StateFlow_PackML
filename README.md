## Motivation

I wanted to play with State flow in Simulink and see if i could replicate the basic PackML structure. I plan to extend it to include more features of packml, it might be quite fun to make a model with code spaces where code can simply be dropped in.

## Description

Its a simple model of the production mode of the packml state machine.
Its currently driven via boolean inputs to test the movement through the state machine.
Building with TE1400 for TwinCAT will give you a realtime simulink model for packml running in TwinCAT.

## Support

LOL, little old me now, all by myself :-)

## Requirements: 

Please include important requirements in the local readme files.

Currently nothing more than:

TwinCAT 4024.54
TE1400 2.8.2.0
Matlab R2019 or later (Im using R2022b)
Simulink Coder
